      <h4>Bi-Weekly Cleaning:</h4>
      <p>
        For those who prefer a bit more flexibility, our bi-weekly cleaning
        service offers a comprehensive cleaning every two weeks. This schedule
        allows for a focused approach on areas prone to more dust and mold due
        to a longer timeframe between cleanings. Our team addresses these
        specific needs to keep your space in top-notch condition while
        accommodating your preferred cleaning frequency.
